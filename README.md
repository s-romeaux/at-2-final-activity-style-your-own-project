# MERN Word Search v1.00

Milestone Project #2 for UNLV Software Development Bootcamp

Challenged to create a MERN stack application, Sal, Johnson, and Zach put their heads together to create a Word Search!

## Game Description

Select letters on the grid to complete words related to web development, such as Mongoose, Fetch, and API. You can select words that are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, and forwards or backwards.
